Here's what the report tells you about the execution of your Triangle.c code:

Overall Coverage for Triangle.c:

Line Coverage: 66.7% (6 out of 9 executable lines were hit)
Function Coverage: 100.0% 

Line-by-Line Breakdown:

Lines 1-8: These lines, including the printf("equilateral triangle.\n"); statement, were executed at least once
Line 9: printf("isosceles triangle.\n"); was not executed (indicated by 0 in the "Line data" column). This means the fuzzer did not find any inputs that led to the program identifying an "isosceles triangle" that was not equilateral.
Line 12: printf("triangle.\n"); was not executed (indicated by 0 in the "Line data" column). This means the fuzzer did not find any inputs that led to the program identifying a generic "triangle" (scalene).
Line 15: printf("non-triangle.\n"); was not executed (indicated by 0 in the "Line data" column). This means the fuzzer did not find any inputs where the side lengths did not form a valid triangle.
Line 17: The return; statement at the end of the triangle function was executed (indicated by 1).
